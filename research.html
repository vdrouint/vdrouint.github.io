								<h2>Fractional vortices and confinement</h2>
								<span class="image left"><img src="images/imgEPotts2.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Astonishing physics sometimes reveals itself in the most unlikely places. The melting of 54COOBC,a molecular liquid crystal film of a single layer, exhibits a phase with a hidden order parameter.  In order to explain the unexpected specific heat signal and the peculiar sequence of phase transitions, I studied the finite temperature phase diagram of a system of coupled classical vectors. The results, obtained using a specially devised Monte-Carlo algorithm, show the existence of a new phase which was not previously found. The nematic-hexatic model studied encompasses the competition of nematic molecular order and hexatic bond-orientational order; the challenge here lies in the competition between the two global symmetries. These end up in a state of relative three-state Potts locking. </p>
								<p>The hidden order phase involves a coexistence of free vortices of unit charge with long-range discrete Potts order. The unit charge vortices are bound states of three fractional vortices, and resemble baryons formed from a bound state of three confined quarks. Thus, the solution to this long-standing mystery phase in the liquid crystals is a classical analog of quark confinement.</p>
								<p>Our preprint is available on the arXiv, or <a href="documents/EPotts_vf.pdf">here</a>. I am currently exploring whether dual representations of this model can further reveal the relative order phase.</p>
								<h2>Iron-Based Superconductors</h2>
								<p>The iron-based superconductors are multiorbital systems, in which each iron atom is contained within a tetrahedral environment. The Hund's coupling tends to align the spins in the different orbitals, and this is an important driver of strong electron correlations. </p>
								<p>I have developed a many-body treatment of the Hund-Kondo model, in which the iron atom is viewed as an impurity in the metallic environment. Using slave-fermion methods, this leads to a set of self-consistent integral equations for the self energies of holons and spinons which describe the valence and spin fluctuations of the iron atom. </p>
								<p>The first publication stemming from this work was published in <a href="documents\PRB-Hund.pdf">PRB</a> where we studied the three-orbital Hund-Kondo model using large-N Schwinger Bosons. A follow-up of this work which includes valence fluctuations is in preparation. We are now extending the approach to include spin-orbit coupling at the impurity, which can lead to local pairing of the electrons.</p>
								<h2>Frustrated Magnetism: Spinels</h2>
								<p>I worked with Rutgers Postdoc Sobhit Singh and Pr. Jak Chakhalian's group. Our <a href="documents/NanoLetters2021.pdf">work</a> was published in Nano Letters. </p>
